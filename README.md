# RWS.WordsSlotMachineGame

The way that you play ReelWords is a bit like a slot machine. 
There are 6 reels in total and each reel is made up of various characters. 
These characters are not random but are in a set
sequence that doesnâ€™t change.

Each word inputed need to be in the database and cannot be computed after it matches any caracter 
on the rells available if a word exists on database is not tried before and at least one letter matches with the available letters
showed on the reels you need to move the reel foward and if the next letter is a match you should compute it as well.

Trie structure


the words used and stored on the resources should be stored on memory and be inseted, searched and removed inside a tree trie data strucure.

Enjoy.
